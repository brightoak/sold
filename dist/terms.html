Unless we indicate otherwise, you grant us, our subsidiaries, and affiliates a nonexclusive, transferrable, royalty-free perpetual, irrevocable, and fully sublicensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, copy, and display any Submissions throughout the world in any form.</p>
        <p>You represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control all of the rights to your Submissions and that your Submissions will not violate the Terms of Use or cause injury to any other person or entity. We take no responsibility and assume no liability for any material, content, opinion, recommendation, or advice provided by you in your Submissions or by any third party. We have no obligation to post any of your Submissions, and reserve the right to post our own versions of that content (including, but not limited to, photos of properties or property descriptions) instead of yours in our sole discretion.</p>
        <p>You assign us the right to pursue enforcement of copyright and other intellectual property claims against third parties that have, without authorization, and in violation of the Terms of Use, scraped, copied, or distributed content from your Submissions and for which you have not granted such third parties a separate license to use.</p>
